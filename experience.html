        <h2>Teacher</h2>
        <p>For a little over 20 years, I taught various social studies class at both the middle and high school levels.</p>
        <p>I taught a variety of subjects from Geography and Ethics to History and Economics.</p>
        <p>Although I've been out of the classroom for a decade or so, I still have an active <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/KylePurpura" target="_blank" class="youtube">YouTube channel</a> devoted to demonstrations in Economics.

        <h2>Technology Integration</h2>
        <p>I moved into tech three years ago, working as something called a "technology integration specialist," a fancy term for someone in a school who helps students, teachers, administrators, and parents to make better use technology.</p>
        <p>Last year I worked with over 150 students and teachers, and I hope to work with even more this year.</p>
